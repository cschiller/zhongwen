### Contributors

The Zhongwen browser extension was written by Christian Schiller with
contributions from the following people:

* Todd Rudick (http://rikaixul.mozdev.org/)

* Jonathan Zarate (http://www.polarcloud.com/)

* Erek Speed (http://code.google.com/p/rikaikun/)

* Lenoard Lausen (https://github.com/leezu)

Furthermore, Zhongwen would not be possible without the work of all the editors
who put together, and constantly improve and update, the
CC-CEDICT dictionary: https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict

I also want to thank John Pasden from AllSet Learning
(https://www.allsetlearning.com/about/) for creating, and suggesting
Zhongwen be integrated with, the Chinese Grammar Wiki.
(https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/)

Thanks also to Nick Winter from Skritter for his assistance with
setting up the API for integrating Zhongwen with Skritter.
